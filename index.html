        <p class="lead mb-4">For the longest time, I thought that my athletic abilities would allow me to end up as a professional athlete. From my earliest memory till now, I have been driven by my love of sports. Ever since my parents bought me a basketball hoop, I fell in love with the excitement of any type of game. The three sports that Iâ€™ve always played competitively were basketball, soccer, and tennis. They helped me feel much more confident at a young age and make new friends. I excelled in each one, playing at high levels and winning many championships. In my freshman year, I made the varsity tennis team. The following year, I was on varsity for both soccer and tennis which made it feel like all my work had finally paid off. To say that I enjoyed athletics would be an understatement. I lived and breathed it. <br><br>
But when you love something so much, you have to recognize that sometimes your path may diverge. I originally planned to pursue athletics at the college level and to continue my relationship with sports. However, every athlete must come to the eventual realization that their path has ended. For some it takes an entire lifetime for this realization to occur. It was not easy, but I came to understand that my athletic career would be coming to an end. I was able to make the leap from middle school to high school. However, the slope between high school and college athletics was too high for me to scale.<br><br>
America is a nation of immigrants, and my parents are no exception. My father arrived here from Pakistan and my mother from England, making them the only ones in their family in the United States. I have no relatives in America, only my parents. My experience is no different from others who arrive in America on a yearly basis. I can personally attest that a true hallmark of the immigrant experience in America is isolation.
	From an early age, my parents encouraged me to play sports and I seemed to have a good knack for it. Soccer, basketball, tennis, anything with a ball. So I moved ahead to try and get out of this isolation by trying out for teams and demonstrating my slavish commitment to practices, hard work, and being a part of a team. A game I can clearly remember was my best basketball game I ever played. I had a huge crowd of my family friends who came to support me. I scored 28 points which was my highest ever. It broke me out of my isolation mould because of the way everyone was cheering for me. It was the first time I had all eyes on me and a moment I will never forget. Gradually I began to make more friends - and friends began to find me - and doing so boosted my confidence greatly. 
	Trying to break out of this isolationist bubble is one of the best decisions I ever made. But along with it came another challenge - keeping my academic work up at the same level. It wasnâ€™t easy and I have to work hard to manage the time between sports and school work. Both are demanding and hard to manage as I get older.
